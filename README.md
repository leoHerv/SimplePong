# Simple Pong
  
### Description :   
This game is my first game with a graphic library.  

In this game you have 6 lives and the goal is to make your opponent have 0 life.  
To play, the player 1 need to use the keys 'z' and 's' and player 2 need to use 'down' and 'up'.  
  
### What I learned : 
I learned to use a graphics library, to take into account the fps as well as the keyboard and mouse inputs.  
  
### Compilation :   
To compile the project you need to use a terminal and use :  
-> gcc src/*.c -o pong -I include -L lib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -mwindows  
  
### Specifications :  
This is a side project was made in C with the SDL library, on Windows (comments in French).  
Made at the start of 2022.
